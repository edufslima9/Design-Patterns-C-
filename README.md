# SOLID and Design Patterns C#

### Sample project to study SOLID and GOF Design Patterns in C #


## SOLID

- **SRP** (The Single Responsibility Principle.)
> Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate things that change for different reasons.
- **OCP** (The Open-Closed Principle.)
> A Module should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **LSP** (The Liskov Substitution Principle.)
> A program that uses an interface must not be confused by an implementation of that interface.
- **ISP** (The Interface Segregation Principle.)
> Keep interfaces small so that users don’t end up depending on things they don’t need.
- **DIP** (The Dependency Inversion Principle.)
> Depend in the direction of abstraction. High level modules should not depend upon low level details.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

- **Absract Factory**
> Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**
> Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- **Factory Method**
> Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Prototype**
> Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- **Singleton**
> Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
